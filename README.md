### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently working in a e-commerce pure player company, taking part in different projects as business analyst and team leader.
The challenging and fast-changing nature of the e-commerce landscape has been a stimulating environment to build new products and solve complex problems while fostering a customer-centric mindset.

As a cross-functional intermediary between business and IT, Iâ€™ve had the pleasure to work with people from various fields, on different ranges of problems, needs and ideas.
My strong focus on process analysis, product discovery and business intelligence lets me identify problems accurately and find solutions on par with the company strategy.
Having a keen interest for everything software-related has enabled me to develop a more solid product vision, ensuring a high value delivery in our transformation projects.

Iâ€™m always looking forward taking part in new projects and working on new products, from ideas to launch, and beyond.

Business/Tech Stack:

- Power BI
- Salesforce

- Confluence
- Postman
- Figma
- SQL/DAX/Python (pandas, selenium, requests, gspread)
